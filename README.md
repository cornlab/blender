# **BLENDER**
## About

BLENDER is a companion program to the DISCOVER-Seq assay to identify off-target CRISPR/Cas editing sites from MRE11 ChIP-Seq experiments described in "Unbiased detection of CRISPR off-targets in vivo using DISCOVER-Seq."  BLENDER takes aligned bamfiles from the MRE11 IP experiment and (optionally) a control bamfile and identifies locations with stacks of reads at putative cutsites. PAM sequences can be provided by the user as well as a guide sequence. BLENDER makes use of the ENCODE ChIP-Seq Blacklists for human and mouse which are lists of regions in the genome that have artifactual large numbers of reads. These lists and the control bam plus PAM sequences and the guide are used to filter out false positives.  BLENDER runs on mouse mm10 and human hg38 genomes (blacklists coordinates are for these genomes).

As of March 2023, there are [two versions of BLENDER.](#blender-versions)
* "New" BLENDER (aka ["BLENDER2"](#blender2-aka-blender2py)) uses the same logic as classic BLENDER, but has been rewritten to be much faster and easier to develop against. BLENDER2 will replace BLENDER for all future uses of DISCOVER-seq. Stay tuned for several updates to BLENDER2!
* "Classic" BLENDER (aka ["BLENDER"](#blender-aka-blenderpl)) is the original software reported in [Wienert and Wyman et al Science 2019.](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/31000663/) It is battle-tested but is quite slow. A single run can take 1-2 days on a single CPU, depending on sequencing depth. It is also very hard to develop against, and so new features have lagged behind. BLENDER is provided so that one can compare to historical datasets/results.

## Running BLENDER
BLENDER has a driver script run_blender.sh that takes several argmuments and runs identification of putative hits, filtering of those hits, and then creates an SVG of the aligned hits. Files are stored in the output directory given as a parameter to the bash script.
Alternatively, each step can be run separately. 

## Automated bash scripts
### [New blender](#blender2-aka-blender2py)
        sh run_blender2.sh <path to reference genome> \
            <path to IP bamfile> \
            <path to control bamfile> \
            <guide sequence> <output directory> ["options"]
### [Classic blender](#blender-aka-blenderpl)
        sh run_blender.sh <path to reference genome> \
            <path to IP bamfile> \
            <path to control bamfile> \
            <guide sequence> <output directory> ["options"]

These will run blender with option c set to 3 (details below), this means the program will run quickly, but may miss some very sparsely covered off target sites. I recommend running it initially with c set to 3 (the default) and then running again with c set to 2. Classic blender may take several days to run, but new blender should complete relatively quickly.

# Blender versions
There are two major versions of blender:
* blender2.py: This uses the same logic as blender.pl, but is rewritten to be more flexible and have a much faster backend. It takes approximately one minute for a typical run to complete. It finds the same sites as blender.pl, but with very slight changes to the score. The Corn Lab has switched to using blender2.py, and this version will be the one developed against for all future versions.
* blender.pl: This version was originally published in Wienert & Wyman et al Science 2019. It is  very slow, but has been extensively benchmarked. A single-CPU run can take as long as 1 day to complete and the newer multi-CPU mode can reduce this to 1 hour or so if you have many CPUs. It only works with blunt-cutting Cas enzymes that have a cutsite and PAM location identical to SpyCas9.

# BLENDER2 aka blender2.py
Faster, more flexible, less tested
## Requirements
pysam https://pysam.readthedocs.io/en/latest/installation.html (best installed via conda)

## To run the blender script directly:

        python blender.py -f <experimental bamfile> -c <control bamfile> -g <guide sequence> -r <reference genome> -b hg38.blacklist.bed > unfiltered_output.txt

        python blender.py -f <experimental bamfile> -c <control bamfile> -g <guide sequence> -r <reference genome> -b hg38.blacklist.bed  | perl filter.pl > output.txt

BLENDER can be run with or without being piped through the filtering script. There are two filtering scripts provided; the standard filter.pl script that implements the standard scoring scheme, and the filter_pool.pl script that implements the more stringent scoring scheme for pooled samples.

</CENTER>

## Input & Options
`-f` `--file`           Experimental bamfile (required). This is the aligned bamfile for the MRE11 pulldown of ChIP-Seq of a Cas9 edited sample. BLENDER will extract the reference sequence fromthis file for use in the analysis. I typically use BWA for alignment, but bowtie2 can be used as well. BLENDER has not been tested with bamfiles from other aligners.  **Required.**

`-c` `--control`        Control bamfile. This is a ChIP-Seq for MRE11 pulldown from either unedited cells or cells that have been edited with a non-targeting gRNA. If there are greater than 10 reads in the control sample, the hit in the edited sample is filtered out.

`-n` `--nuclease`       Nuclease to search for. Current possibilities are: SpyCas9, SaCas9, LbCas12a, AsCas12a. **Required.**

`-w` `--window_size`    Override nuclease-default window size for score summing. Cas9 default = 5, Cas12 default = 10'

`-g` `--guide`          Guide sequence. Provided 5'-> 3' without the PAM sequence. **Required.**

`-p` `--pams`           Override nuclease-default PAMs with a space-separated list e.g. `-p GG AG`

`-r` `--reference`      Reference genome in FASTA format. Must be pre-indexed with `faidx` so that an accompanying `*.fai` is found in the same directory as the FASTA-formatted genome.  **Required.**

`-t` `--threshold`      Threshold for number of read ends exactly at a putative cut site. Default is 3. For maximum sensitivity, this can be set to 2 and the filtering scheme applied. **Note that this was formerly option `-c` in blender.pl, but is now `-t` to avoid confusion with the control BAM file!**

`-s` `--score_min`      Minimum aggregated score across a 5-base window around the cutsite to consider a hit (default 3)

`-m` `--max_mismatches` Maximum number of mismatches to allow to the guide sequence (default 8)

`-b` `--blacklist`      Blacklist to use for filtering hits, e.g. from ENCODE (BED format)

`--verbose`             This flag will turn on output of filtered out candidates while running if filtered out for more than maximum mismatches (8) in the guide sequence, or the hit occurs in a blacklist region or it is in a very deep region and 
thus likely an artifact.

# BLENDER aka blender.pl 
Older, much slower, more tested

## Input

`reference genome`	Path to reference genome. If reference has "mm10" in it, then the mouse blacklist coordinates will be used. Otherwise, human is assumed and the hg38 blacklist coordinates will be used.

`guide sequence`	Guide sequence should be provided 5'-> 3' without the PAM sequence.

`IP bamfile`	This is the aligned bamfile for the MRE11 pulldown of ChIP-Seq of a Cas9 edited sample. BLENDER will extract the reference sequence fromthis file for use in the analysis. I typically use BWA for alignment, but bowtie2 can be used as well. BLENDER has not been tested with bamfiles from other aligners.

`control bamfile`	This is a ChIP-Seq for MRE11 pulldown from either unedited cells or cells that have been edited with a non-targeting gRNA. If there are greater than 10 reads in the control sample, the hit in the edited sample is filtered out.

`output directory`

## Options

`-p`	List of 2 nucleotide PAM sequences, separated by commas, in quotes. The default is "GG,AG".

`-c`	Cutoff threshold for number of read ends at a putative cut site. Default is 3. For maximum sensitivity, this can be set to 2 and the filtering scheme applied. BEWARE that this dramatically slows down running time. It can 
increase runtime from ~30min to 24hrs, depending on the guide.

`-j` Number of threads to use (default 1, ideally equal to or higher than the number of chromosomes in the target genome))

`--verbose` This flag will turn on output of filtered out candidates while running if filtered out for more than maximum mismatches (8) in the guide sequence, or the hit occurs in a blacklist region or it is in a very deep region and 
thus likely an artifact.

# Output

Both blender.pl and blender2.py have identical output formats.

The automated bash scripts output `unfiltered_blender_hits.txt`, `filtered_blender_hits.txt` and `blender_hits.svg` to the output directory provided by the user. This raw unfiltered output can be used for exploring bamfiles to assess whether adjustments might be needed for the scoring scheme. The output text files have the following columns: 

`Chr:Start-End`  Genomic coordinates of the putative guide

`Cutsite`  Where the cutsite is within the guide

`Disco score` Score given to the hit. Essentially summing a window of read ends around the cut site

`Cutsite Ends` This is the number of read ends that pile up at the cutsite. When you set the 'c' parameter, it is this value that is set. 

`Strand/PAM`

`Guide sequence`

`Mismatches`

The scripts also create an svg image of the hits something like this.

## Demo

Demo data is included in the DEMO file. The DEMO directory contains data for running BLENDER on a single chromosome (chr19)
for DISCOVER-Seq from MRE11 ChIP-Seq of the VEGFA site 2 guide in K562 cells.

Bam files for the IP file and the control file (BFP ChIP) are provided in the bwa
directory and expected output can be found in the expected_output directory. Chromosome 19
has three off-target hits.

To run BLENDER on the demo data, use the following command in the main blender directory:

	sh run_blender.sh <path/to/reference/genome> \
    		DEMO/bwa/BW43_VEFGA.chr19.bam \
    		DEMO/bwa/BW44_BFP_control.chr19.bam \
    		GACCCCCTCCACCCCGCCTC DEMO/blender

	sh run_blender2.sh <path/to/reference/genome> \
    		DEMO/bwa/BW43_VEFGA.chr19.bam \
    		DEMO/bwa/BW44_BFP_control.chr19.bam \
    		GACCCCCTCCACCCCGCCTC DEMO/blender


For BLENDER, this will take approximately a minute or less to run. Runtime for BLENDER2 is about 2 seconds. 
The three output files can be found in the DEMO/blender directory. Because the bam file is just for chromosome 19, the output figure 
shows just the 3 hits found on chromosome 19 (image below is for BLENDER, with same sites but slightly different score for BLENDER2)
